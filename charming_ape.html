                    <p class="section-content">Recently there has been a rise of monkeypox cases in Australia, whereby
                        Victoria and New South Wales to this day make up 43.3% and 44.4% of cases in Australia
                        collectively. Globally, the data reflects males to make up 98.87% of cases with more than 50% of
                        these cases being within the age range of 20-69. However, the top 4 infected countries show that
                        the majority of their cases are inferred to lie within ages of 25-34. Monkeypox has been stated
                        to have a higher rate of infection via extensive skin to skin contact, with a lower rate of
                        infection via fluid. With countless people working in the service industry requiring extensive
                        periods of consistent skin to skin contact, increases their chances of catching the virus. How
                        might we raise awareness to male Australians in this industry who are constantly exposed to
                        extensive skin to skin contact about monkeypox and prevent them from getting the disease?</p>

                    <p class="section-content">
                        Backend was designed based on the microservice architecture following a serverless cloud-native
                        development model. Function as a Service (FaaS) provides a platform ,which allows rapid build,
                        run, test and deployment of an application. The characteristic of ‘separation of concern’ allows
                        future update and maintenance to be performed relatively easily without having to interrupt any
                        other functioning features.</p>

                    <h3 class="section-sub-heading">Event-driven & FaaS</h3>
                    <p class="section-content">
                        FaaS has been divided into two roles, with one responsible for retrieving data from the database
                        and the other role responsible for updating the data in the database. Regarding the event-driven
                        characteristics of FaaS, two types of trigger have been used. API calls, as the first trigger,
                        is essentially a request from the frontend, which will be served as an event invoking the
                        backend query functions for retrieving data from the database. Scheduled event rules, as the
                        second trigger, was achieved using AWS CloudWatch to create tailored timed events, which will
                        serve as the trigger of backend database update functions to update the requested table.

                    <h3 class="section-sub-heading">Machine-Learning Model</h3>
                    <p class="section-content">
                        Size limit of FaaS was a big obstacle for the automation due to the
                        fact that our team lacked of experience of working with self-developed ML model. Without the
                        assistance from AWS, the most viable
                        solution at that time was to utilise both the database and CRON-job scheduling (Linux native
                        scheduling program) to achieve daily prediction of Monkeypox cases in AU. With database as the
                        middleware for frontend-tier to request and CRON-job as the scheduling tool to trigger the model
                        runs and inserts the results into the database daily.
